1;technical-support-fundamentals;By Daniel W;May 23, 2018;"Course was good overall. I will not take the time to discuss in detail the information taught; it was delivered well and was valuable. However, after watching many many minutes of these videos, it became really redundant for the first 15 seconds of each video to be an animation reminding me of where I am in the course. This is redundant because it is obvious where you are in the course when you navigate to any video.. in any course. The website displays where you are. I do not feel I need to be reminded with 15-20 seconds of silent animations showing me where I am; I just want the video to start. Secondly, it was really frustrating to be failed on the final writing by my peers for the most heinous complaint. We were directed to describe how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to someone who has never seen one before. Because this is all the information given, I have to assume the user has seen some sand-which; just not a peanut butter and jelly one. I do not feel I should have to teach someone how to open a bag of bread. It should be common knowledge that something has to be opened to get it out. I should not have to teach kitchen etiquette and cleanliness. One user who failed me commented that because I did not direct him to set the bread on to a clean plate... that he was confused; and could have mis understood to the point where he placed the sandwich on the floor. Another user said that I should have described how to hold the knife. He did not know if he should hold it by the sharp end, or the handle. One of those users marked me off for not being concise because it did not use bullet points or numbers and that he was expecting a recipe format. Look! I am not here to suppose a user came out of a cave. When you fail me for these types of issues using this logic; that same logic makes me think I should describe how to make a sandwich by growing your own wheat, making grain, baking bread, growing strawberries to make jelly, etc. But I did not go that far! No... I simply re wrote my project and upload to accommodate these 3 users by including that the bread should be opened, how to hold a a utensil, and I even included images of the sandwich so that the user could check their work as it is assembled to ensure the user could make a sandwich in 14 simple short sentence steps labeled accordingly. Well guess what?! My project was graded by another 3 users who complained that it is common sense how to hold a knife and remove bread from a bag and that I should have given them more credit for having some level of food assembly knowledge and I barely passed. I passed by 1 point. Yah, they almost failed me for being too lengthy. Honestly, I only added 3 or 4 short sentences compared to the original. Being graded by your peers gives too brought of feedback in cases like this. If the last 3 users would have graded by first paper, I would have passed. If the first set of users would have graded by second paper I would have passed. Lastly, I got an email upon completion of the first course that said my certificate was ready to print once I uploaded my photo ID (drivers license) along with a second photo of me for validation. Once I uploaded these 2 images; I got a notice that there was no certificate to be given for this particular course. I would not have shared my personal information with you at this point in time if I knew nothing would be available to print yet. That too was frustrating. "
2;technical-support-fundamentals;By Ramses S;May 17, 2020;This felt like an honest waste of time. The course could have been completed in 2 days by my 8 year old daughter. I highly doubt any employer will take this certification seriously when they see it on a resume. In fact, I would not be surprised if an employer decided to NOT hire the applicant by seeing this on the persons resume. I literally did not learn a single thing from the entire course. The final exam was to write an essay on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. What in the honest F does that have to do with IT??? I really wish I did more research. I watched a YouTube video of a guy who applied to 300 jobs after receiving this certification and did not get a single callback aside to work at the mall as an Apple genius. Apple geniuses don't need ANY experience!!! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I hope my review is not removed, the world deserves to know how much of a waste of time this course is. 
3;technical-support-fundamentals;By Alexandra H;October 05, 2018;Starting from scratch, I feel like I've gained a great basic understanding of IT support. It was informative, and it has motivated me and left me hungry for more. I am pumped to start the next course!
4;technical-support-fundamentals;By Alto P;May 08, 2019;Great course for beginners and experts. Easy to understand  and a good refresher for those who have been into IT for a long date. Recommend it to everyone looking for a high quality course on coursera.
5;technical-support-fundamentals;By Joel M;February 16, 2018;Great introduction to IT and the different standards that are used in the field. It really gives you an idea of what to expect and the different aspects that you may encounter while you're on the job.
6;technical-support-fundamentals;By Fragiskos K;March 10, 2018;An excellent introductory course. The all around material was well presented, the instructors are doing a great job passing on their knowledge. The weekly assignments were interesting and fun to take. 
7;technical-support-fundamentals;By Zack J;January 31, 2019;Please edit out the unnecessary/stupid 10 sec intro to EVERY video! In course 2, there are 89 videos. That's 890 seconds or 14.8 (basically 15 min) of pointless and meaningless time taken from the students! And that is just counting the videos from the second course!!! I'm not going to count how many videos are in all 5 courses of this program, but I'm assuming its in the hundreds. That's a lot of wasted time for a 10 second intro on every video! And with some personal experience in video editing, I know that it really wouldn't take someone that long to go back and edit out the intros. I think someone could probably do it in a full work week (40 hrs) time. Also, I like cheesy phrases, jokes and puns, but some of your guys scripts are bad cheesy. I know you guys were just trying to be funny and not make it a boring video, but man it was down right bad sometimes. If you ever update or redo it, I would cut out some of the cheese! Other than that, good job!
8;technical-support-fundamentals;By Barlow M;July 31, 2018;I am working in IT and wanted to do a refresher on the fundamentals and this course is really worth it. Good job Google and thank you for an affordable solution to getting my refresher and certificate
9;technical-support-fundamentals;By Satyam D;May 16, 2020;I actually have some experiences in IT so doing the course was very easy for me, but the content is awesome. It will be really beneficial for a beginner. I am looking forward to complete next courses!
10;technical-support-fundamentals;By Troy B;January 28, 2019;Not bad for rookie, but a bit too simple for someone of my experience looking to get the certs needed to use my skills in a workplace. I'd advise a test-out option for each portion of the IT Cert course. 
11;technical-support-fundamentals;By Dixit P;March 06, 2018;Awesome course designed by google. Thank you very much. Knowledge gained in just introductery leactures started burning desire in me to complete whole syllabus. Every bit of program is worth the time.
12;technical-support-fundamentals;By Alexander D;April 10, 2020;Well made and simple to understand, had previous experience and it was dead on. Great for beginners and a great refresher for people trying to get a cert for their resume or to expand their knowledge.
13;technical-support-fundamentals;By Dustin H;November 15, 2019;I loved how useful all of the information in this course was.  I love how much the instructors really seemed to be so in love with their careers. Its the most fun I've had learning in a very long time. 
14;technical-support-fundamentals;By Tim R;May 13, 2020;Very enjoyable forums, videos, and interaction as a whole. I have taken similar classes in the past but the way that this course works makes it so much easier for me to be interested and stay focused.
15;technical-support-fundamentals;By Dawn V;February 03, 2019;Currently at end of Lesson 3 in Tech Support Fundamentals Thus far the information has been very simplistic.  The only challenge I've had, ironically, is one of the main reasons I signed up for this course. I was tired of searching countless websites, help FAQs to find reliable instructional materials. In lesson 3, one of your video modules featured text that varied from video. And the challenge, trying to get the multiple VM instances for assignments to correctly function per your lesson instructions.Your multiple instruction modules for Quiklabs and Linux VM instances, and the Windows instance, could use revamping. Especially since the lesson on Quiklabs is combined with Linux assignment instructions. The Windows instructions, though the Win assignment is first, differ slightly between the various readings and videos. Since I am between above-average and advanced user of PCs and Windows, I was frustrated with the time wasted in setting up VM Quiklabs environment for assignments that would take minutes to complete. I've been methodically pursuing self-education, interspersed with college courses when able, for years. I hoped your Google IT Support courses would provide documentation of my studies, and eliminate sorting through the growing internet flotsam to find educational resources. I intend to give this course another week or so. However if lesson levels remain low, and/or the problems of VM Quiklabs are not easily resolved, I doubt I'll continue. Respectfully, Dawn Volk
16;technical-support-fundamentals;By Christopher L;March 04, 2019;A lot of technical issues with labs that made the class very frustrating to try and complete, especially when you have to pass the labs to move on. Had no other issues with the class then that.
17;technical-support-fundamentals;By Joseph N;September 30, 2018;There are a few mistakes in the video where the person spoke the wrong thing, Those video should be redone so it doesn't look unprofessional for Google. But at least they are not boring. I was dissipointed with the lab especially on the linux one which should been easy, but the grading system doesn't want to update my score. 
18;technical-support-fundamentals;By Stacy G;June 13, 2019;If your aim is to be a user-facing IT support staff, and not someone working in the backend of a datacentre, this is pretty essential stuff! The content is kind of dry but it's presented in a good way. I wouldn't recommend this course on its own (as in, not part of the Google IT Support Certification) if you are looking to just work with computer systems or backend duties, however - I think you'd be better off focusing on the more technical offerings from this course!
19;technical-support-fundamentals;By Preda;May 20, 2019;This was a terrific course for a high level overview of what is to come in the rest of the Google Professional IT Support course. All the speakers were energetic and their strong interest in their respective areas were very encouraging for me as a student. After the Technical Support Fundamentals course, I really felt like I wanted to continue with the rest of the courses. I am now learning the Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking because of this course.
20;technical-support-fundamentals;By TJ ( H;May 21, 2019;This is a great overview of all the basics for beginners or a fantastic refresher for anyone looking to move into a more advanced support role. 
21;technical-support-fundamentals;By Ned R;April 07, 2018;Great content, but I couldn't get the Linux graded assignment to work. After a few days of back-and-forth with customer support, I was about to quit the certificate, but they out of nowhere approved the work I'd done despite their previous refusal to accept my screen shots. I guess I'll keep going?
22;technical-support-fundamentals;By LaTryce J;February 18, 2019;Getting to windows through Qwiklabs with the password (typing several times) and it not logging me in is a pain!  I am using a Mac Pro OS.  Not easy and taking several hours to achieve.  Very frustrating.
23;technical-support-fundamentals;By Reuben K;September 13, 2020;Great course! Good start for any IT career. I love the fact that there are no pre-requisites required to enroll. Not even a high school diploma needed just your willingness to learn. Thank you Google!
24;technical-support-fundamentals;By Deon B;June 16, 2019;It was mostly informative, especially the building a PC section. But that same section has two options for the exam, and one of the options will still appear after you have done the other. That makes your progress appear to be stunted on that section, which is confusing.
25;technical-support-fundamentals;By Arif A;January 15, 2019;Really easy and effective way to learn in this day and age where people do not have time to go to the classroom.
26;technical-support-fundamentals;By Billy R R;March 16, 2019;Very accessible and entry level.  Can breeze through it in a day if you already know the material and don't feel OCD about skimming or taking notes you can simply skip to the chase and knock out the tests.  As far as material goes, it's decent, but the transcripts are filled with typos which makes it difficult for someone new to the information to pick up accurately if they don't know the jargon.  Many of the tests which require moving things around in a browser window are buggy or extremely poorly designed.  The multiple choice and peer reviewed tests are decent.
27;technical-support-fundamentals;By Abshishek R;March 04, 2020;You were such a hit. Thanks for this course and the next five more!  On behalf of our entire organization, thanks again for taking the Conference to a whole new level of education and professionalism!! 
28;technical-support-fundamentals;By Jacob M;September 25, 2020;This course really is foundational. The instructors are awesome, the labs are relevant and they all work! I have gained so much knowledge just from this course. I can't wait to further this knowledge.
29;technical-support-fundamentals;By Jitu p;April 24, 2020; Great course for beginners and experts. Easy to understand  and a good  refresher for those who have been into IT for a long date. Recommend it  to everyone looking for a high quality course on coursera.  
30;technical-support-fundamentals;By Ariel G K K;June 13, 2020;Thank you very much for this amazing course, I learned a lot and I am very excited to start a career and to apply what I have learned.  Thank you very much to all the lecturers and thank you to Google.

32;technical-support-fundamentals;By Thomas M;April 17, 2020;Amazing introductory course, well structured and well presented with exercises and hands on labs. If you're looking to learn the fundamentals of computing, this is a great place to start your journey. 
33;technical-support-fundamentals;By Endri S;June 04, 2020;This was a very fun course! I really enjoyed the style and pace of the information given. A lot of technical information was given while the course made it easy to take in and comprehend the material!  
34;technical-support-fundamentals;By Anwar A  E;November 26, 2020;It was great learning with all the mentors and I learned lots of new things and also get to know about the experiences of the mentors themselves. Also, I am looking forward to continuing this journey.  
35;technical-support-fundamentals;By Grzegorz S;May 04, 2020;Still a great refresher to me and listed in a comprehensive manner which I am thankful for even though I knew some or even a lot of these fundamentals already in a distant and previous life of mine…
36;technical-support-fundamentals;By Tommy P;April 14, 2021;This course was a friendly and educational start to the certificate, I will recommend this to anyone either looking to develop skills in IT or if they just want to gather more skills for personal use.
37;technical-support-fundamentals;By Ronald P;June 05, 2020;This course is excellent for those who would like to learn the basics of IT and would like to broaden their knowledge. I enjoyed seeing videos from multiple instructors who actually work in the field. 
38;technical-support-fundamentals;By Vernessa M;October 24, 2020;I would recommend spending hours completing your course if your are currently unemployed and have the time to spare time to learn a new skill to improve your career, its precise, easy and informative. 
39;technical-support-fundamentals;By Chava V R;July 19, 2020;This is such a wonderful course that I had ever. Especially that role plays in week-6 about customer service is pretty awesome. Thank you google for making us knowledgeable and enjoyable both at time. 
40;technical-support-fundamentals;By YALAGANDULA S C;May 25, 2020;Great course for beginners and experts. Easy to understand and a good refresher for those who have been into IT for a long date. Recommend it to everyone looking for a high quality course on coursera.

42;technical-support-fundamentals;By Juan B;August 05, 2020;I enjoyed all the presenters of the videos, they really took their time to get me involved and explained all the content clearly. I also enjoyed the videos that talked about current and future trends.
43;technical-support-fundamentals;By Pedro l;August 08, 2020;excellent, the content contemplates fundamental concepts in many areas, allowing participants to have a clear and general view of the world of it support regardless of prior knowledge. Congratulations
44;technical-support-fundamentals;By Ronald H B;February 20, 2021;This was an excellent course even for a novice in IT.  The only thing that I would add is a glossary of terms so that they could be readily accessed during the course-----so many terms, so little time.
45;technical-support-fundamentals;By Deborah T;September 01, 2020;I enjoy this course and highly recommend it to students with now prior experience in the IT area.  I also recommend this course to students who are returning to the IT area and need a freshener course.
46;technical-support-fundamentals;By John V;May 10, 2021;This is an amazing course for both a complete NOOB and self taught geek like myself. If you're thinking about taking this course I HIGHLY recommend it and PROMISE you'll learn something very valuable.
47;technical-support-fundamentals;By Jiun-Ren W;January 02, 2019;This was a great introduction to the field of IT. As someone who hasn't been in a classroom setting of any kind in almost 15 years, this program was paced really well and gave me lots of opportunities to succeed in my learning. Can't thank the team that supports this enough.
48;technical-support-fundamentals;By Constantine C;March 22, 2019;"Qwiklabs suck big time, look what I just got in my mail: ""Hello Constantine,Let me introduce myself, I am Priyanka at Qwiklabs and I am in charge of your happiness. Priyanka from Qwiklabs"" Not only their systems are not working and choose to ignore all those people complaining, their support staff are rude too. So much for ""Technical Support Fundamentals"", ah, the irony! "
49;technical-support-fundamentals;By Leung T Y;July 07, 2020;Preview of the course: This is an apple, apple is a fruit.  For everything else, you can check it out at the next Supplemental Reading for apple. So we learned about the apple in the last section, now we learn about apple juice.  We put the apple into a grinder to make juice.  Details are in the next supplement reading.  
50;technical-support-fundamentals;By Vidish p;March 26, 2018;took the money n does not update assignment in week three despite completing it numerous times... a common complaint from other students. Now the money is gone, course completed but no certification and no helpline to talk to.
51;technical-support-fundamentals;By Shana T;March 26, 2020;Very good overview that was quite informative. I appreciate the format of the course with the videos, quizes, discussion and assignments. I look forward to the next courses and completing the program.
52;technical-support-fundamentals;By Andris R;November 14, 2020;El curso te permite iniciar en el mundo de el soporte TI al ofrecerte las herramientas y conocimientos esenciales que colocan las bases para trabajar como profesional del soporte TI. Gracias excelente

56;technical-support-fundamentals;By Hassan M;December 28, 2021;This course clarifies everything you need to clear your basics for Technical in IT. Even though I am already in IT Field but i come to know some new methods and techniques for troubleshooting process.
57;technical-support-fundamentals;By Creston L;November 28, 2018;It's trivially simple, but for some reason I'm stuck waiting for a peer review.  Why should the willingness of others to grade my work inhibit my progress towards this course? The Peer review system is the biggest weakpoint of this cert-program. Major problem.
58;technical-support-fundamentals;By Greg s;April 09, 2020;"Made it to end of week 5...Too many software glitches (with Quicklabs /graded tasks) to continue...Even the Quicklabs Chat line could not even fix them or help ""during the five (5) times I tried to complete the two ""week five"" graded tasks...I am going to unenroll till GOOGLE fixes this problem...I wanted to to do this so bad...I could taste it...I wanted to work for GOOGLE after earning this certif., but, I feel it is impossible for a person like me (living with disabilities) to deal with so many software malfunctions currently associated with the courses' Quicklabs /graded tasks...GOOGLE: If, you read this...please contact me...so I can to finish this course , once you get these problematic software glitches (in this course) fixed as i really want to work for you (GOOGLE  ) ... The instruction and instructors were GREAT...Just the software glitches (with Quicklabs /graded tasks) were the roadblock... Example of problems experienced in one of the attempts: Could not proceed with ""install, update, and remove software in linux"" lab as putty.exe would not run due to (fatal error message)...qwiklabs download ppk would, also, not run and an error message stated ""this file does not have an app associated with it.""

62;technical-support-fundamentals;By Jose L R S;May 07, 2019;Fácilmente entendible. Da una amplia visión del mundo IT y te deja con ganas de seguir descubriendo este asombroso mundo.
63;technical-support-fundamentals;By Preston;April 27, 2019;I enjoyed the course. It felt too easy at times, content wise, but as Google has stated it is designed for people that have little to no experience with IT. I think a better way to describe it might be for people who have little to no experience with computers. If you use a computer regularly in your personal life or at work, you might find some of the content a little watered down. If you have no experience in customer service the 6th week does provide useful tips. At the same time, I totally understand the necessity of laying a basic foundation for a field of study that is likely foreign to most of those enrolled. This course is trying to lay the groundwork for the subsequent courses by introducing you to the material and how the course itself works.  I have two main issues with this course. Grading/quizzes: I think the quizzes should be more extensive for sections 2-5. Peer review is a good way to supplement what you are learning but does not make a good grading tool. The rubric is so minimal in week 6 (documentation section). It would have been more helpful to just read more examples of good and bad documentation. I understand the limitations of an online course with thousands of people enrolled. It would be impossible to manually grade assignments, but if the courses were free and Google charged for an exam to get the certification similar to how other IT certifications work, that would negate these downsides.  Supplemental Reading: The supplemental readings are usually links to Wikipedia pages or websites. In most cases the Wikipedia pages go in fairly in depth past the general summary. This is definitely a field that strongly encourages independent and supplemental study and I can understand the course reinforcing that, but considering the fundamental nature of the course, I would have liked to see some more options alongside Wikipedia entries. It is not to say that Wikipedia entries are not helpful, but I expected for a paid course there would be something a bit more curated. Overall I learned from this course and enjoyed the experience, but the reasons listed above are why I gave it 3 stars. 
64;technical-support-fundamentals;By Anthony R;June 16, 2019;"This specific course is fairly useless in all honestly. I finished all 6 weeks worth of work within 4 hours. The class goes over what Binary is (something which you don't need to know as a support specialist even as a senior specialist or high level manager), how to install/uninstall software, how the internet works, and how you should use common sense when writing out documentation. 95% of this course if fluff and can be summed up in three simple Google searches (ironic isn't it?) This specific course will just waste your time with redundant tasks. I spent 30 minutes (28 minutes of that was waiting for access to QwickLabs) proving I know how to install software. If I'm using an online learning platform like Coursera and accessing RDPs/SSH it is extremely unlikely I wouldn't know how to use a web browser or install one. Likewise no one I have ever met in my 10+ years in IT has ever needed to count in binary unless you're doing cryptography which is entirely different than standard ""support"". That's a whole other specialization that requires far more demanding study. I think this entire course should be made as a free supplemental material and dropped from the Google Professional IT Support Certification requirements."
65;technical-support-fundamentals;By Benjamin S;May 22, 2020;Basically an IT course for Boomers. If you're under 45, you likely already know all this.
66;technical-support-fundamentals;By Ann H;March 15, 2020;I really enjoyed learning so many new things. It would be nice if there had been a bit more instruction on Qwiklabs. Is there a glossary of terms and acronyms on the site I am missing. I asked on the message board but never received a response. I will double-check that in a moment. Are there books you recommend we read as we go through the learning process? Finally, the tech team was most helpful in answering my questions THANK YOU!!!  Ann Happ
67;technical-support-fundamentals;By Elianeth F;January 25, 2020;This course has helped me to refresh and update many things, I have a technical background but I had separated a little from the theory. It is a very good way to start training in this wonderful career of IT Support, of the things that I liked the most has been to understand how the internet works, handle procedures that save you time, the detail of customer support. I am ready to advance to the next level. Thank you Google and Coursera.
68;technical-support-fundamentals;By Nishant K G;April 20, 2020;When I started this course I just had a basic knowledge about Computers, but after completing this course I feel like I know about Computer (Hardware, Software, Networking) now, obviously, there's a lot to learn about Computers, its a very vast field, but this course helped me build my foundations on Computer. Thanks, Coursera and Google!
69;technical-support-fundamentals;By Ariana B;January 02, 2019;Very helpful in giving you the basics and foundation to build upon. I recommend this course even if someone has already taken something similar. It never hurts to level set and make sure your foundation for learning and understanding is solid.
70;technical-support-fundamentals;By Karthik M;December 04, 2018;It worth reading and going through videos . Thanks Google

74;technical-support-fundamentals;By Marco R;March 01, 2020;Really good course for those wanting to sink their teeth into IT and also a good refresher for those who've been into technology for a while. There are some minor bits newcomers will be confused on due to the course forgetting some things but it's overall something I'd recommend to someone.
75;technical-support-fundamentals;By DAVID E M V;September 01, 2020;thanks Ahora en mi idioma original Muchas pero muchas gracias, a decir verdad es mi primera experiencia, pero ha sido la mejor, siento satisfacción y honra, al tener personas tan pero tan preparadas y tan humanas y excelentes personas, no tengo como describir mi emoción, a ustedes muchas gracias, y espero poder tener maneras de seguir aprendiendo de ustedes, solamente me dieron 2 meses y no pude tener mas que esto, pero igual, espero poder aprender mas de ustedes por este medio o directamente de ustedes, muchas gracias. 
76;technical-support-fundamentals;By Thomas J;October 29, 2020;This course was a great introduction to the aspects of Tech Support. The instructors were great, the content was kept basic enough for someone who is coming in with no knowledge whatsoever. I was familiar, at a basic level, with many of the subjects but it just resulted in my going through the estimated 6 weeks in about a week and a half. I expect that I will slow down that rate as I take a deeper dive into these subjects and end up out of my comfort zone.
77;technical-support-fundamentals;By Sir E;July 20, 2022;The Course is great. I've been a Systems Administrator for the past six years but decided to take this as a refresher and I'm truly refreshed with new ideas and important tools. Can't be happy enough!
78;technical-support-fundamentals;By Sumanth H S;February 04, 2022;Great course for beginners and experts. Easy to understand and a good refresher for those who have been into IT for a long date. Recommend it to everyone looking for a high quality course on coursera.

80;technical-support-fundamentals;By Baryliuk Y;August 01, 2020;This course teaches about IT security yet it requests to publish photo of passport to unknown checking service. When leakage will happen nobody will compensate my troubles caused by the leakage.
81;technical-support-fundamentals;By Duke B;May 16, 2020;I'm not sure why I wasted my time to be some kind of customer support representative for problems my grandmother would call about. I only have myself to blame.
82;technical-support-fundamentals;By Bryson D;April 08, 2020;This stuff is taught in middle school. I didn't learn a single thing. What a joke to charge $50 for this...
83;technical-support-fundamentals;By Jigme L;August 17, 2020;in this course i completed all and i am not getting certificate. am not happy with that but i leaned lots
84;technical-support-fundamentals;By Michael H;July 30, 2020;Too simplistic. This may be best for someone that has no understanding of computers. 
85;technical-support-fundamentals;By Mauricio C;June 27, 2021;it doesnt teach you enough to become an IT technician, just a waste of time
86;technical-support-fundamentals;By AADARSH J;May 18, 2020;Not get certificate
87;technical-support-fundamentals;By Divan;April 11, 2020;Thanks for the course! The Only things is the certificate is not signed by Google so it looks kinda fake.
88;technical-support-fundamentals;By Mohammad A F;April 11, 2021;This course has to be the best course you can do in my opinion starting from the ground in the IT Field no matter if even you have come from a different field, trust me this course is for you and other beginners in the IT field you may know of and once you finish the course and receive that certificate in your hands, you say to yourself, WOW! I really have done it! and that's exactly the feeling I got. This course does not also give you the best feelings once completed but also gives you the knowledge that may take a year of schoolwork in just 6 weeks which you can easily complete each week of work if you are at an intermediate stage of IT before you start the course in just a day each, so you may be able to finish the course in just 6 days like me before even your trial ends if you have the time to do so and if you are feeling sceptical about it just remember that you have time to cancel before the trial ends so there is no worry whatsoever but I wouldn't think at all that, that would be necessary. Even if you are the best of the best or even the worst of the worst, my point is that there are things you will 100% learn even at the highest or lowest level while keeping you entertained throughout it! I do hope this review helps any people who are on the verge of doing it or not but just remember that you have to commit when you enrol and you will find about other students just like you of which you will be able to interact with. Overall, This course is the best for people coming from different fields or even just the highest fields of it to give a refresher and gives you tips, tricks and also a lot of learning in depth of topics such as making a computer or less technical things such as customer service and how to interact with them in awkward for you situations and turn them in the best scenario possible. Many Thanks for anyone who read through and hope that it cleared up any doubts that people were having. Goodbye!
89;technical-support-fundamentals;By SUNDAY C O;June 03, 2021;"Before now, I was really ignorant of all I have successfully learnt here. I was just a mere user! But today, thanks to Google, I have a clear idea of computer networking; computer assemblage(although I will continue to read deeply on them); the history and usage of the internet, how the computer works using binary; troubleshooting and various technics to solve customers' IT problems. It is amazing the training on how to relate with a customer in the process of troubleshooting. A lot of experiences and knowledge have been garnered from this course, and I am eternally grateful to Google and Coursera. Although this IT Support programme is fundamental, it is the bedrock and platform on which many of us would build our careers in this noble Information and Communication Technology industry. I am so elated to have learnt all that I learnt here and to be hopeful that one day, I will be tasked to put them to test by solving IT problem. I am so happy for the experience I have gathered in this course. I, therefore, give God, Google and Coursera the glory, thanks and appreciation respectively."

From the first introduction module to how to get through a Technical interview, I have learned a lot and make a lot of experiences such as the best practice to troubleshooting,  an exciting experience in mastering now the binary code by reading and making more search about it, a small language detail between bytes and bit could be a huge difference. Practice times! Virtual machine - Accessing Qwiklabs, I think we need to insert more practice modules."

161;cloud-computing;By Syphax A;Oct 7, 2022;"I find this course very rich on the part of the information it provides, and this is both a point of strength and a point of weakness. As I have some previous information about the field, it has helped me a lot to digest new concepts. But nevertheless, I had the problem that in the course, concepts were substantially delved into theoretically and without graduation, and that's the opposite of how I learned in the Google course on the Coursera platform, so I ask you to focus on this point.
As for the content, I liked it a lot and I want to attend more courses with you, thank you Meta!"
162;cloud-computing;By elbalili s;Nov 5, 2022;Well, it's brief introduction the android app development process.

I downed the rating to 3 stars because at the end of ""Introduction to Android Development"" course there are a few mistakes in grading the assessments, but those errors can easily be fixed. Also, the solution offered for the project phase is not functional, at least for mp4 video files. I think more clarification on this issue must be made in the course, especially for those who study programming for the first time."
174;cloud-computing;By Jose L;Sep 7, 2022;It isn't too bad as it teaches you the principles however it gets too complicated to the point where it gets difficult to follow.

176;cloud-computing;By Roland S;Feb 14, 2021;Course can only be completed with a IBM Cloud account. If you don't have access to a corporate email address and internet access with a corporate IP address, you will be probably blocked by the IBM Cloud spam filter. I constantly got the following error message:
177;cloud-computing;By Igor D;Jan 30, 2021;It is more advertisement of IBM than course. Music in background is annoying, and IBM use cases clips (poorly edited) just make you believe that you are on IBM site.
178;cloud-computing;By Ryan F;Sep 23, 2020;Wasn't impressed with this format. There was too much time dedicated to the videos and not enough practical work. ie. the chance to demonstrate more understanding of the content.
179;cloud-computing;By Khaled U A;Oct 10, 2020;The practical part is too litter and the course is not interactive.

189;cloud-computing;By Nate R;Feb 17, 2022;"Unfortunately this mostly felt like an ad for IBM cloud computing. Uneven delivery, concepts are too vague, overreliance on jargon rather than solid concepts. Redone ADR for certain sections, yet the woman couldnt be bothered to prononce correctly for those sections. Woman can not pronounce ""ing."" Therefore I had to hear ""computeeen"" and ""executeeeen"" and ""starteeen"" repeatedly which is a huge pet peeve. Only completed as part of larger IBM devops course. useless on its own."
190;cloud-computing;By Belisario M;Feb 10, 2021;If you are thinking of working with any cloud based computing technologies this course is great! I think you can take the knowledge of this course and feel comfortable when going to take a cloud practitioner certificate exam from any of the major cloud providers (IBM, AWS, GCP & Azure). Obviously you should still study for the specific exam, but this is a great course for the foundations of cloud computing!
191;cloud-computing;By Kiran V;May 3, 2020;"A fascinating course on the topic ""Introduction to Cloud Computing"" by the IBM Cloud team. You get to learn the fundamentals of the topic from the IBM Cloud team. The real life applications of cloud are amazing and can inspire any professional/student to achieve a position in the cloud industry.Thank you IBM Cloud."
192;cloud-computing;By Robert L;Jul 4, 2021;Very good start to learning about Cloud Computing. It covers the wide range of topics involved with cloud computing and had many use cases and examples to help with understanding each subtopic.
193;cloud-computing;By Ganesh K;Aug 13, 2020;Excellent course. I never realized so much of knowledge can be packed in a 5-week course. The assessment really evaluated the understanding. The lab was interesting.
194;cloud-computing;By IamSRayhan;Sep 4, 2020;A very effective capture to learn hoe cloud infrastructure work. There are so many things to learn from this course. I have cleared my concept of cloud computing.

196;cloud-computing;By maneesha j;Jun 6, 2020;EXCELLENT
197;cloud-computing;By Mariana C;Mar 10, 2021;I liked the introduction course. The classes with the human beings presenting are great. The only critic that I have is that the classes that don't have people seem more like if you are in a selling presentation of the service, with only benefits of using the technology been said by a mechanical voice, whether than with the intention to make you understand the subject itself. If it is possible, I think you should considerer making more classes with the teachers.
198;cloud-computing;By Elrate99;Nov 19, 2021;"I'm very disappointed. At first, I couldn't register an account with ibm cloud for more than a month. I contacted support, and they, in turn, asked to write an email to the department that was supposed to help me. So I did, but I didn’t get an answer. I wrote letters more than three times to no avail. Then I asked my friend from California to register an account for me. Hooray! Happened. A friend registered an account, and I activated it, but after 3 days my account is deactivated. By writing a letter to the ""verify.us.ibm.com"" mail, they finally answered me. But the answer was:"
199;cloud-computing;By Jonathan V C;May 4, 2022;"The only good part was the videos where someone explained on a board, everything is kind of marketing for IBM Cloud, even the final exam is on IBM Cloud, where if your trial expired they will ask for your credit card, in my case they don't accept my credit card, declined by some error, the solution create another email, the thing is that is like my 3rd course from IBM and I'm out of emails, learning should be free, and if I already paid coursera, then they should not try to charge you additional or ask for credit card on another section of the course, it's like ""pay for your certificate"" and also like ""hopefully you forget all the things you create on IBM cloud so I can charge you later for that""."

201;cloud-computing;By Ivan S V;Nov 29, 2021;E?xcellent overview in Cloud computing. Very high level comprehensive material to initiate the path to cloud developer or architect. After this course there are other courses in the specialization that dive deeper into the intricate details of cloud computing, devops and cloud architecture. This course is the best place to start, and I have taken courses from Oracle OCI and AWS, but this is less marketing and more general knowledge applycable to any cloud platform.
202;cloud-computing;By imtiaz u;Mar 8, 2021;I can't express my felling right now . for a quite a long time i was preparing myself for this course . As all the course in coursera are well design .

203;cloud-computing;By Hemashree.S;Oct 24, 2020;Very Informative and helpful indeed. I have understood the concepts clearly and also able to confidently move forward in the cloud computing career. I would recommend this key specialization course to all upcoming and interested individuals who would like to be a part of the cloud. Thank you.
204;cloud-computing;By Vinod K;Mar 13, 2021;I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It has lot of visuals and will not get bored while taking this course. Very well designed course. Also, the practice tests are very helpful to gauge the knowledge we gained in the lectures. Thank you for this course
205;cloud-computing;By oyewole s;Mar 21, 2021;In my honest opinion, this course has helped me understand the cloud concept better and I really can't wait to move on to the next stage. The instructors took their time to explain each concept in ways that anyone can easily grasp.
206;cloud-computing;By David A;Mar 15, 2021;Good overview of cloud computing. Tutorial for setting up IBM Cloud account and easy $200 credit. Cloud storage lab exercise lets you create a cloud bucket and share a file via unique link. Especially good for trial users.

210;cloud-computing;By Nathan M;Aug 29, 2022;This course was not nearly as engaging as the first one in the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate, Introduction to DevOps. The first course has a very engaging speaker (live person) the whole time. I was disappointed that this course was devliered 95% of the time by an automated-sounding recording with text-heavy slides. It makes the content more difficult to retain. I appreciated the few times there were live presenters.
211;cloud-computing;By Bharat B R;Feb 4, 2022;Lab tutorial it self is not working to complete this course. I have spoken to customer care but they are saying get help form stackoverflow.

216;cloud-computing;By William D;May 25, 2021;Good introductory course, though there are a few inconsistencies with how some of the lessons are taught, which was honestly just a bit jarring to me. The course also says you don't need any prior knowledge coming in other than basic computer literacy, but there were a few segments related to networks that I felt a bit lost on.
217;cloud-computing;By Sayed M;Jan 22, 2021;Excellent explanation, content and visuals. I found useful description for CI/CD section since I already had some prior experience with cloud. Someone who wants to get familiar with fundamental concept can take this course to get familiarity about cloud concepts.
218;cloud-computing;By Olisemeka P O;Jul 14, 2022;Good course for a foundational knowledge of cloud computing. You might experience some hardship in learning if you need a one-on-one tutor to learn effectively as there are only pre-recorded videos and transcripts.
219;cloud-computing;By Peter G;Dec 24, 2020;Very easy to understand fundamentals training..... definitely a recommendation! The final exam could have been more challenging,  going deeper into the subject... let student experiment more in IBM cloud....
220;cloud-computing;By Karthiban G K;Jun 11, 2020;This course gave me a clear picture of fundamentals of cloud and its services . The assignments like creating instance and buckets in the IBM cloud was really helpful.Cloud insights!!!!
221;cloud-computing;By NATARAJAN M A;Jul 29, 2020;The course very useful for beginners to the topic, the content telling is in a good manner, yet there are some more complications in later weeks.

I was super excited for it at first, then got a little discouraged by the quality of some videos (voiceover not following the video, inconsistent volume), then got excited again. All in all, it's a fantastically structured course. I can't believe that you can finish a course over the weekend and really get an understanding of the fundamental concepts of cloud computing.
240;cloud-computing;By Nicholas;Dec 25, 2021;G?reat course and great learning content. I do wish that the assignment would be updated to meet the cirriculum of the IBM cloud storage website and account creation. There were some unexpected problems I ran into such as false flag spam emails (which were my personal emails no less) and also the issue of linking the exact assignment tasks. Otherwise the learning content that this course provided was very well done. I learned a lot about cloud storage and how it is working in professional environments. Cybersecurity is something I wanted to understand at a greater level and this is the introductory course to start mastering this field.
241;cloud-computing;By Abdur R;May 31, 2022;"This is best course for those who curious  about how internet things and cloud storage work . if you don't have prior knowledge in cs  you may have face some difficulity during this course, after some time you will grab those things from your hard work then everything will be going smothly.

A small correction, I have completed this course before 30days of course time and I'm not a computer science student but I have spirit to know how computer scince and internet things work. That spirit gave me 100% grade in this Introduction to Cloud Computing course. In the future, I will aquire more skills in this feild."
242;cloud-computing;By Heather W;May 5, 2022;I have just started this course but I think its great so far. It is self paced and it enables me to go as fast or as slow as i need to. I can also go back as many times as i need too to review something  that i dont understand or are having a hard time with.  My work schedule is all over the place and  being able to learn around my work hours is just what i was looking for in a course. The best part is the price. I dont have to take any loans out  or sell my first born child to pay for it because it is very affordable!

It really dives into database structure as well as basic SQL commands. When I say ""basic"" commands, I really mean the bare-bones commands, nothing too intense.  For instance, they don't talk about  ""joining"" tables or even doing ""Union"" commands.  Another thing is that while they dive into the database structure, they really do not discuss different database tools (Azure Data Studio, dbeaver, etc...)."

? Pros:
- Summarizes pretty good all the concepts and skills you need to get started with Relational Databases and SQL.
- Provides enough information and Labs to learn what you need to conceptualize, design, and maintain Relational Databases.
- After this course, you should be able to implement a fully functional database for a project.

? Cons:
- I would've loved to have more Labs, since I enjoyed a lot working on the ones that are included.
- This course would be more valuable if you were taught how to deploy a Relational Database in the cloud, or in your own server (this might be covered in a later course so this might not really be a con)."

347;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Sharon F;Jul 7, 2022;I found the entire course very interesting, as it presented the full spectrum of web development.  The material was presented very well, step by step, and was easy to understand.
348;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Dominik G;Jul 23, 2022;4? weeks about React and Bootstrap, no value for backend developers
349;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Leonardo R;Aug 2, 2022;Amazing intro, learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and React lightly but clear concepts. Most recommended for a first approach for non-techy backgrounds.
350;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Temitope A;Jul 12, 2022;This is a fantastic course. It was well taught, and quite practical too. Looking forward to the other courses
351;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By chao c;Aug 9, 2022;It's good for beginners, though we mostly focus on the front end, not much on the back end.
352;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Ruisi T;Aug 31, 2022;To simple. To easy. Not informative. Quiz questions are vague.
353;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Lucio F F d A;Aug 5, 2022;I absolutely loved this course  and I think it's the best introduction to Back-End development. It not only describe the role of a Back-End developer but it also covers all the basic of Front-End development and UI frameworks that should be enough for a beginner Back-End developer to start with. So that way you don't get overwhelmed by the front end stuff you will likely never use as a Back-End developer. If you're a Back-End student I highly recommend starting with this course, because it is right to the point and it covers things like HTML forms, css/bootstrap grid and some other basic things that you need to know.
354;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Sarwar S;Sep 6, 2022;T?his course is really helpful and amazing, it has simple explanation videos, the assignments was really joyful and interesting.  I get to learn about React and it's use in such a simple way. The core information about internet technologies such as HTTP, web server, application servers are really useful. The additional content after every module contents lots of deep information about the topics.
355;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By dale g;Aug 4, 2022;Another brilliant course. Introduced to networking, HTTP principles, and some front-end technologies like HTML and CSS that lay the foundations to becoming a back-end developer. Thanks to the instructors, who are brilliant.
356;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Fauzan;Jul 7, 2022;The courses are very interesting using a variety of teaching methods from videos, readings, quizzes, labs and exams. In addition, the explanations are very easy to understand and are followed by visualizations that make the material easier to understand
357;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Khanh C;Jul 12, 2022;This course is great for both beginers and experiences. However,  I recommend ones who have at least basic programming before starting this course since this course is a little fast pace, it could be hard to follow if you are a completely beginer.
358;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Fremah M;Aug 5, 2022;The trainer is well informed on the subject matter and she breaks down the course into easy digestable instruction which is easily comprehended.
359;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By robyn h;Jul 31, 2022;I really enjoyed this course. The practice was great. I was blown away by the ability to code within the course, rather than by download. I did download the IDE to practice on my own.
360;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Mahmoud A;Aug 24, 2022;g?reat course and a great step in the backend development career . i'll finish the other courses in this track as i found this course amazing and full of helpful information
361;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Peter P;Aug 5, 2022;This is a must do course for future front/back end developers! It is worth the time and paitence.

365;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Mahmoud S A A E F;Sep 13, 2022;Doesn't cover the basics of CSS and Bootstrap and it assume you have some knowledge about CSS and Bootstrap. Not beginner friendly but you still can make your with some external resources.
366;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Benoit G;Jul 23, 2022;waste of time, learn nothing, too much videos, half the link don't work. Not a good place to learn right now.
367;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Shivani J;Sep 3, 2022;"This course will give you a great introduction to Web Developement. After completing this course you will get a bigger picture of how things move between front-end and back-end, along with many other necessary details on the subject. 
The only thing I felt missing was the connection with the teaching staff or any moderators. I noticed there were issues about which many learners were confused but I found no response from the team. I didn't see any place in the course where I can leave some feedback, thats why I am writing it here. Thanks"
368;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By David D;Aug 19, 2022;Sinceramente ayuda muchisimo, me gustaria un poco mas de ejercicios practicos, pero del resto todo excelete. Tendre que aprender aparte CSS que fue lo mas confuso para mi.

370;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By ABDULLAHI S S;Sep 1, 2022;A very good option for complete beginners but one needs more resources in order to master HTML and CSS as not everything can be covered. I suggest w3schools.com and developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ . There's also htmlreference.io and cssreference.io .

573;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Jaime G G;Oct 6, 2022;H?ere are some improving points, in my opinion:
574;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Ericka G;Sep 21, 2022;T?he course was good. Little fast paced for a beginner but great class. My lab didn't work until the very last day, so I was blind to what I was creating. The learning center for help was no help, but the other students really came through. Over all, I would take it again.
575;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Nitin;Aug 21, 2022;Overall, It was good! A great start for someone who is just setting foot inside the web development community. Looking forward to take the upcoming course and dive deep into these certification program.
576;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Michael A;Jul 27, 2022;This intro is a gentle overview of the front end, for many like me, it is a refresher course that adds new skills to old capabilities. I look forward to diving more into the back end of development.
577;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By alfredo o;Sep 11, 2022;O?verall the course is solid, and provide a good, but broad understanding of the topic. An area that could be improved is the assignments, they feel a bit too guided and easy.
578;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Mohammad Z;Aug 20, 2022;The course teaches the basics of internet, html, css and bootstrap. The overall structure of the course was good but I feel that lectures were a little bit rushed and the tone of  the instructor  was devoid of any humour and even felt robotic.
579;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Yathin B M;Oct 25, 2022;C?ourse is good. Topics are slightly off from the intent of this course. Weeks 2-3 are mostly on HTML/CSS/Bootstrap which are more related to Front End Development.
580;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Zejd I;Aug 25, 2022;Very basic course with easy assesments. Maybe even 3 stars, but I am thrilled in waiting for other courses in this Specialization
581;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Lily;Nov 1, 2022;some subtitles or captions have errors such as inconsistency or slower or faster than the corresponding speech in the videos.
582;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Dhruva E;Sep 3, 2022;A great introduction  to the internet world and it's technologies. Could've been more challenging if included more labs.
583;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Mohamed A A;Aug 9, 2022;I hope it had more videos than articles. I also hope that bootstrap was explained in more detail. But it was good.
584;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Rudra S;Aug 9, 2022;T?he course's name is introduction to backend development but they taught all about front end. kinda confused now.
585;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Shamrai M V;Jul 28, 2022;As for me, that's introduction to front-end development and not back-end development
586;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By MATTHEW B;Oct 2, 2022;T?he second aspect is Python that I see and I have been told it will be Javascript
587;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Justin B;Sep 27, 2022;v?ery broad overview of interent as well as a look into back end development
588;introduction-to-Back-End-Development;By Sandra C;Sep 11, 2022;T?he autograder for the submitted labs needs tweaking but outstanding course.

622;introduction-to-Android-Mobile-Application-Development;By Regina J;Sep 16, 2022;The code they showed in the video was done on some earlier version of android studio. some things did not work like the path to the video file.

640;programming-in-Python;By Richard C;Sep 16, 2022;T?his course is very close to being excellent in many respects, but it has some very serious issues that make it a frustrating experience.  The production quality is very good and the course includes some material that most Python courses completely overlook.  In particular, I am very impressed that the course dedicates a week to talking about different programming paradigms.
641;programming-in-Python;By Ahmad R H;Jul 30, 2022;It was a great Python course that covers the main topics all coders and engineers need, now it will be up to us to continue our learning journey. The instructors did a great effort in preparing this course, the sample codes and assignments were really helpful to ensure correct understanding and eliminating doubts about concepts. Finally, I would like to thank the instructors, Coursera and Meta for such a great learning experience.
642;programming-in-Python;By Michael;Jul 19, 2022;So far I've felt like all of the Meta courses have had good pacing and thorough explanations. However, unlike the other courses I felt like this programming course in particular had less hand holding and more psuedo code in the instructions that required you to do more critical thinking to complete the assingnments which is definitely more effective in ensuring that you're learning.
643;programming-in-Python;By Viktor K;Aug 19, 2022;"This is a wonderful course, made with soul.
This is a wonderful story in simple words about complex topics.
Huge thanks to the amazing creators and Meta Corporation.
I am a refugee from Ukraine studying to find a job and this course has been a huge support for me and my family during a difficult time after russia's dastardly attack on Ukraine."
644;programming-in-Python;By dale g;Aug 4, 2022;Thanks Meta for a very comprehensive course.
645;programming-in-Python;By Infinite I;Jul 24, 2022;Thoroughly enjoyed this course. It had a good mix of challenging programming assignments and I feel like I learned a lot about python
646;programming-in-Python;By Jérémie P;Jul 11, 2022;G?ood course to start Python or for intermediate Python that want a refresh presented in an interactive and easy way.
647;programming-in-Python;By Maliik M;Aug 30, 2022;"The very basics of Python and programming are covered in this course, but it lacks any in-depth explanation regarding core concepts and Python specific features. There's not much info in this course about what goes on ""under the hood"" and that can leave you wanting for more and better explanation. I had to buy a Python book to really get some of these concepts, and that's okay, but I think people looking to take this course should know that there are some serious gaps here and this course alone won't really prepare you to build anything on your own."
648;programming-in-Python;By Timothy P;Aug 19, 2022;Honestly this course is a very good tool for learning or refreshing your knowledge in Python.  Compared to the Google courses, this course is more intense as well as more hands on in many ways.  I found Google's courses were good, but more fluff.  Here there is very little fluff, which is a good thing when doing these online courses.  It means though that you have to pay attention and NOT skip any videos!
649;programming-in-Python;By Hamzah A;Oct 9, 2022;amazing
650;programming-in-Python;By Edwardo L;Aug 29, 2022;Instruction, instructor, and lessons are all incredibly useful. This course is challenging, but it truly builds a solid foundation both for learning the basics of python, and real-world use and application of the language. I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge--and it can get challenging--and I know feel more confident and emboldened to continue my journey as a back end developer!
651;programming-in-Python;By Maruf H S;Sep 18, 2022;I?t's a good course for building the foundation in python programming. Though all the basic things are touched but they are not as comprehensive as need to be. This course will put you in the track and show the path to walk on. Also the lab assignments are helpful to strengthen your basics.
652;programming-in-Python;By Fauzan;Jul 15, 2022;The material presented is very basic although there are lots of them but if all the basics are given it will be clear in the future, the most challenging thing is every time you do a programming assessment with all the tests for testing it. Thank you for the course
653;programming-in-Python;By Natalie S;Aug 27, 2022;This course was so easy to learn and I loved how the information was presented. I have taken other programming courses on other sites such as Udacity but I found this to be presented in a much better way! I feel confident in my python skills now.
654;programming-in-Python;By Iván Z;Sep 2, 2022;Very great course, i learned more about Python and related stuff and now i have a good idea of some of the possibilities that are open to you once you learn and practice this programming language.
655;programming-in-Python;By David S;Jul 31, 2022;Great course, while taking it, i was also a python college course. This course helped to provide a more indepth understanding of the concepts I was learning
656;programming-in-Python;By ksenia g;Sep 18, 2022;V?ery good and concise course explaining the fundamentals of Python, software development workflow and paradigms.
657;programming-in-Python;By Sam Y;Oct 9, 2022;"G?reat course.
I wish it was a little more practical and functional. Nonetheless, it is far ahead of all other Python courses online.

723;programming-in-Python;By AM;Aug 23, 2022;Great course. Covers a range of topics.  Some nice interesting assignments.  However, some background/auxiliary concepts are just not needed and are just there to confuse and muddle the learner.  For example, algorithms, big O notation, popular Python libraries, and Testing .  These concepts are not needed when beginner python syntax is the focus of this course and what the learners are actually interested in.    Worse is that these concepts are to be memorized and not to be skipped over since they are part of the graded quizzes.

767;react-basics;By Alberto V Q;Oct 31, 2022;Very good course for someone who has used JavaScript in the past but never React. One could go out and create a very simple React web app after the course but it is best to continue into the next Advanced React course as there are a lot of topics not covered here. The objective of the course is more of giving you an understanding of the concepts and constructs in React rather than applying them in real life.
768;react-basics;By humayou a;Oct 16, 2022;I?t was an amazing experience to have such a great course, I have tried learning react from many platforms but I couldn't enjoyed that, that was kind of borring experince for me, but This course really made me amazed, I don't know how I became this much efficent and hardworking, this is my first day in this platform and I have completed lectures of whole week in a day, still learning.
769;react-basics;By Eliseu N;Oct 27, 2022;"?the use of hooks could have more explanations, but for a beginner course it does has a lot of topics to cover, 
I?f you jump into it be aware you need to have a javascript foundation, code is one thing, but understanding what is under the hood is the key to mastering React.

797;react-basics;By Rajitha H D S;Oct 13, 2022;My only concern is the lecturer in this course. Most of the time, I got the impression that he was just talking like a robot with no teaching skills. instead, the course content is excellent.
798;react-basics;By Vivek M;Oct 26, 2022;I?t was awesome ,got some deep understanding of the react.Waiting for the next course!!
799;react-basics;By Himash J;Oct 5, 2022;This should focus on explaining basic concepts more. Overall good course though.

802;introduction-to-software-programming-and-databases;By Mr. A A;Aug 26, 2022;Although I am a tyro, a complete novice  with the use of computer. I want to thank you all instructors for all that you are releasing in these courses, especially these ones that I have completed.  I really want to know, and I will continue to read and read again until I am on top of it. But I want to plead with the writing team to please try and proofread before posting. Although English is my second language, and I am not too good but then then puntuations  are very key because they can make a lot of difference in what one reads, and also helps one to underastand better. But above all,  you are great! Thank you immensely,
803;introduction-to-software-programming-and-databases;By Lisa T M;Jul 4, 2022;I have done multiple online courses through coursera. Very few courses incorporate labs into their curriculum. I was pleasantly surprised by all the labs requirring me to get some hands-on knowledge on how to use the software on my own in the future. All the course material is relevant and in use today. Really enjoyed this one. So much co that I was looking forward to every test and every lab walkthrough.

This is a wonderful story in simple words about complex topics.
Huge thanks to the amazing creators and Meta Corporation.
I am a refugee from Ukraine studying to find a job and this course has been a huge support for me and my family during a difficult time after russia's dastardly attack on Ukraine."
822;version-control;By jwsarge;Aug 14, 2022;While this does not get beyond the basics, it is good to have a real solid understanding of the fundmentals. As a self-taught hobbyist, I really appreciated it and feel like I now have a much more solid foundation to build more complex methods on top of.
823;version-control;By Timothy P;Aug 20, 2022;I think that this is a really helpful course if you have never used version control.  In all honesty it can be done in about an afternoon if you understand what you are doing.  Make sure that before you go into this course though that you set up and become familiar with Git and Github.   By knowing just a bit, this course will be a breeze.
824;version-control;By Emmanuel N;Aug 13, 2022;Covered basic git and command line and gave ineresting ways to use them both. Introduce more compelex logic like head nodes in git and provided options to actually use git, clone, fork and even make pull requests that might one day be merged. A well rounded Beginer friendly course.
825;version-control;By Obembe S D;Jul 17, 2022;Beyond my expectation and the instructor knows what she was doing.
826;version-control;By Jim H;Jul 19, 2022;Very good instruction and introductory course to Git/GitHub.
827;version-control;By Amanullah A;Aug 17, 2022;It was a great course and learn about Git, Github, and CLI  to download, manage, and update a project. The only problem was the second week which did not explain to download the git bash first to follow the instructor's instructions.
828;version-control;By AHMET B K;Aug 22, 2022;Week 2 had some problems with Bash on Windows part. Other than that, great course!
829;version-control;By Alberto V Q;Oct 11, 2022;?A great introduction to the Unix ecosystem and Git. I have never encountered other version control systems other than Git (and Perforce) at work so learning about the topic more in detail was useful.
830;version-control;By Jeffrey C;Aug 26, 2022;It works as an introduction, but don't think you'll gain any sort of mastery of git and version control once you complete the course. That will require you doing your own homework and finding other resources to learn Git/Version Control. With that said, I appreciate Meta for developing this course and all the specializations.
831;version-control;By Nicholas G;Oct 25, 2022;O?n the first lab the instructions they place out are out of date due to updates that github has pushed out. The lab cannot be completed if you follow the course's instructions.
832;version-control;By Michael;Jul 18, 2022;This course made Git, GitHub, and Command Line a lot easier to understand and took away a lot of the intimidation with working without a GUI. It demonstrated and went step by step on all the commands you need to know while collaborating on a project and setting up projects. And the additional readings contained a lot of useful resources that I'll come back to.

I would like to thank a lot to Meta."
835;version-control;By Ndiaye N F;Sep 24, 2022;V?ery good course. People always just give you a cheatsheet of command line arguments to use Git without explaining anything and I could never find good ressources I liked for my style of learning. This is a pretty perfect course. It's so well explained everything feels easy.
836;version-control;By MD S I Z;Oct 28, 2022;A? great course to build foundation on version control. Really apprtiate this course.
837;version-control;By Goncharenko A;Sep 5, 2022;Great course. Git was always confusing to me. It's getting much clearer now. It's better to apply new knowledge to remember material. And review it again and again if you forgot something. That's totally ok, that's how our brain works.
838;version-control;By Maruf H S;Oct 2, 2022;T?his course was fairly good for people who wants to understand the basics of git and github. Understanding how the git workflow, diff command, forking and pull request works was charming.
839;version-control;By Sam Y;Oct 9, 2022;"This is by far one of the best courses on Version Control.

951;version-control;By Richard C;Sep 16, 2022;I?t's a decent course.  I think that, like all of the Meta courses, it dumps a lot of information on you very quickly without making you do very much with it.  I think they should do a separate course on bash commands and then allocate more time to the git material.

953;version-control;By Adriana L;Oct 31, 2022;S?ome of the instructions were not very clear and the videos were really hard to follow because there were too much of new information to take in and we couldn't even think about it.
954;version-control;By Zejd I;Sep 27, 2022;I?t is introductory course, but it shouldn't be so easy. Laboratories and quizes can be done within 5 minutes although it says you need 1h. You should make those more difficult
955;version-control;By Eric K;Sep 10, 2022;A g?ood, well-paced, and thorough course. The course is beginner friendly and the instructors were great. But not enough hands-on practice in my personal opinion.
